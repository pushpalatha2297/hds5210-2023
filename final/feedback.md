**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**(-1) Generic variable names like `df` or `df1` are not acceptable.  They make it hard for the reader to understand what is going on and what this variable refers to.**

**(-1) I found your notebook a little hard to follow.  You needed to include more documentation along the way, especially to explain WHY somethign was being done.**

**Overall, a great finall project.  Nice work!!**
