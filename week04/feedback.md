# Week 4 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.


## Final Score: 9.5/10

## Multiple Choice:
_Did you complete and submit the multiple choice part of the assignment?_
* Complete

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* All code worked as expected
  * **I wanted 20.1 sorted alphabetically by last name, but you sorted by the length?  It still produces the same result, but wasn't what I'd asked for**

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
  * **(-0.5) You need to use variable names that are more descriptive than `i` and `j`**
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
